/* Other values from http.Request to consider...

	// TransferEncoding lists the transfer encodings from outermost to
	// innermost. An empty list denotes the "identity" encoding.
	// TransferEncoding can usually be ignored; chunked encoding is
	// automatically added and removed as necessary when sending and
	// receiving requests.
	TransferEncoding []string

	// Form contains the parsed form data, including both the URL
	// field's query parameters and the POST or PUT form data.
	// This field is only available after ParseForm is called.
	// The HTTP client ignores Form and uses Body instead.
	Form url.Values

	// PostForm contains the parsed form data from POST, PATCH,
	// or PUT body parameters.
	//
	// This field is only available after ParseForm is called.
	// The HTTP client ignores PostForm and uses Body instead.
	PostForm url.Values

	// MultipartForm is the parsed multipart form, including file uploads.
	// This field is only available after ParseMultipartForm is called.
	// The HTTP client ignores MultipartForm and uses Body instead.
	MultipartForm *multipart.Form

	// Trailer specifies additional headers that are sent after the request
	// body.
	//
	// For server requests the Trailer map initially contains only the
	// trailer keys, with nil values. (The client declares which trailers it
	// will later send.)  While the handler is reading from Body, it must
	// not reference Trailer. After reading from Body returns EOF, Trailer
	// can be read again and will contain non-nil values, if they were sent
	// by the client.
	//
	// For client requests Trailer must be initialized to a map containing
	// the trailer keys to later send. The values may be nil or their final
	// values. The ContentLength must be 0 or -1, to send a chunked request.
	// After the HTTP request is sent the map values can be updated while
	// the request body is read. Once the body returns EOF, the caller must
	// not mutate Trailer.
	//
	// Few HTTP clients, servers, or proxies support HTTP trailers.
	Trailer Header

	// RemoteAddr allows HTTP servers and other software to record
	// the network address that sent the request, usually for
	// logging. This field is not filled in by ReadRequest and
	// has no defined format. The HTTP server in this package
	// sets RemoteAddr to an "IP:port" address before invoking a
	// handler.
	// This field is ignored by the HTTP client.
	RemoteAddr string

	// RequestURI is the unmodified Request-URI of the
	// Request-Line (RFC 2616, Section 5.1) as sent by the client
	// to a server. Usually the URL field should be used instead.
	// It is an error to set this field in an HTTP client request.
	RequestURI string

	// TLS allows HTTP servers and other software to record
	// information about the TLS connection on which the request
	// was received. This field is not filled in by ReadRequest.
	// The HTTP server in this package sets the field for
	// TLS-enabled connections before invoking a handler;
	// otherwise it leaves the field nil.
	// This field is ignored by the HTTP client.
	TLS *tls.ConnectionState
